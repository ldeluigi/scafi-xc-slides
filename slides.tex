    \frametitle{Context}
    \begin{block}{Macroprogramming}
        Programming paradigm for \textbf{large-scale distributed systems} of agents aimed at expressing the \textbf{global behavior} of the system while abstracting away from the local behavior of individual components.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Aggregate Computing}
        A macroprogramming technique for defining the overall behavior of a network of devices through a single program.
        %
        \ac{AC} benefits from the \textbf{composability} of functional programming and the guarantees on emergent behavior and properties provided by its formalization: the \textbf{\ac{FC}}.

    \frametitle{Background}
    \begin{blockitems}{ScaFi: Aggregate Programming framework}
        \item \textbf{Internal \ac{DSL}}: ScaFi offers an internal domain-specific language for defining aggregate programs (see example)
        \item \textbf{Scala 2}: the host language for ScaFi is Scala 2, natively targeting the \ac{JVM}
        \item \textbf{Based on \ac{FC}}: ScaFi's construct syntax and semantics are based on the \ac{FC}
        \item \textbf{Runtime}: the framework offers a runtime environment for executing aggregate programs on a network of devices based on \textit{Akka}
        \item \textbf{Simulation}: ScaFi provides a simulation environment for testing aggregate programs, with \acp{GUI} and playgrounds, as well as integration with the \textbf{Alchemist} simulator
        \item \textbf{Multiplatform}: the core and simulator of ScaFi can be compiled into JavaScript
